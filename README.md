# personal-website
Hello! This is a personal site I've created to highlight a few of my skills and personal achievements. 

This site will be an ongoing project that I will continuously update as my career progresses. 

Site is accessible at https://alexandersuglio.github.io/personal-website/

This site is built off of a template I obtained from https://bootstrapmade.com/iportfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-websites-template/

I tweaked various elements of the main template to create something unique that worked for me.
